            <a href="https://twitter.com/naval">A wise man</a> once said that your résumé is just a documentation of all your sufferings. Sending a list of my sufferings to potential employers is kinda <i>tricky</i>, so here it is, since this website is no-holds-barred! 
          </p>
          <h3>Résumé</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Went to K.J. Somaiya College of Engineering, Mumbai to study Information Technology. Struggled pretty much all throughout and ended up with a cumulative GPA of 8.2/10. Learnt enough web development during this time to be able to build this website.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li>
              Joined AitoeLabs, a startup whose entire tech stack was pretty much in C++ when I joined. I had not written 5 lines of C++ before joining. Wrote several libraries, ML engines in C++, became the Engineering Lead of the company and helped them win $1.4M ARR. Built a lot of cool products with a super talented team.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
               Realized that I have only one body and decided to get fit. Went from 90kgs to 72kgs and dropped body fat to 12.8% The struggle was/is real!
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
               Found out that I liked doing research, so joined the Computer Vision research group at IIT, Bombay with pretty much zero experience in research. Spent countless sleepless nights over a period of 2 years with Suraj Kothawade and others learning every possible Shell scripting hacks and enough machine learning/computer vision know-how to publish two papers at WACV '19 in Hawaii.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
              Was invited by my alma mater, to give a series of talks on how to get started with research. Had barely any public speaking experience before and found myself having a huge case of imposters syndrome. Got through them and mentored quite a few students who attended the talks with their research projects later. 
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
              Spent the whole year of 2018 trying to read War and Peace. Read one chapter a day from the 1st of January and finished it on the 30th of December and pretty much forced myself to form reading as a habit.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
              Moved to Munich, Germany without knowing German. Struggled to buy groceries but worked on a fixing the decline of reading with great people at the Digital Product School and built a cool app (Bukdu, available on the Android Play Store).
            </li>

            <br>

            <li>
              About to start grad school at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University in Fall '19. Still haven't found an apartment in New York City which is a bit of a struggle.
            </li>
