            I'll be honest, there is no reason for me to add this page. But having just an "About Me" section on the navbar looked weird. So I thought I'll use this space to let you in on why I experiment, why I bother writing them into essays and what my general ideas are behind these posts.

            One of my biggest inspirations is Richard Feynman. One anecdote he shares in his book <i>"Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman"</i> is about an interaction he had with a couple of his classmates in college. They used a tool in mechanical drawing class called a <u>French curve</u>. Nobody knew what was so special about it. So he explained to his classmates that a French Curve is made so that at the lowest point on each curve, no matter how you turn it, the tangent is horizontal. All of his classmates' minds were blown at this <i>discovery</i>. These were students at M.I.T. and had gone through many years of calculus classes to know that the derivative of the minimum of any curve is zero (horizontal). Prof. Feynman says that <b><i>"..they didn't even know what they knew!"</i></b>

            This was one of those <i>book dropping</i> lines for me and made me question whether I truly knew the things I learnt. I've realized that the best way to understand something is to be able to explain it in simple terms. The goal I have with these posts is to do exactly this - explain what I've learnt in as simple terms as possible, and make my understanding of these topics better, because there is no point in just knowing the names of things.
